DOCKERFILE
- update the instructions to use sed from nicholas
- add in cleaner documentation for using the Dockerfile in docs/
- probably create a subdir (if possible) for the dockerfile and scripts? (look for reference repos)

REPO
- should I have just forked the repo? (might ask later -- maybe ill just keep this for the tutorials)
- look at the github issues and see which ones can be addressed by your Dockerfile
- ask professors if you can add a branch and make a pr for the Dockerfile on the main repo
- if that is the case, however maybe I should just fork the repo?



Functionality:
1) vx_cl_warpSpawn()
   -> To be used by pocl->ops->run

2) newlib Integration (LoadFile(""))
   -> To be used by the Rhinio benchmarks

3) POCL OPS Vortex Suite

Performance:
1) Icache doesn't need SEND_MEM_REQUEST Stage
   -> Blocks are never dirty, so why not evict right away 

2) Branch not taken speculation

3) Runtime -02 not running on RTL, and -03 not running on RTL and Emulator


Vector:
1) Cycle accurate simulator (would require Cache Simulator)
